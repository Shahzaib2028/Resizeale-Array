# Resizeale-Array

Resizable/Dynamic Array is my 3rd semester course Data Structures and Algorithms project. We are a group of three members.
Group Members:

1-) Raheel Siddiqui (18B-010-SE)

2-) Mohammad Shahzaib (18B-016-SE)

3-) Mahnoor Ismail (18B-109-SE)

This project have following Functions:

1)Insert At First

2)Insert At Last

3)Insert At Middle

4)Delete From First

5)Delete From Last

6)Shrink (Delete By Value)

7)Find Minimum

8)Find Maximum


The main concept of this project is to resize the array like we enter any element in the array so it will increase the size and if we delete the element it will decrease the size. So by this we can save our memory and memory efficiency is the main part of any project.
